# ToDo-App
my attempt at making a ToDo-App by myself

This project was for me to see if i could make a ToDo-App without looking at any code from other sources.
The project has flaws but this was for me to put my knowledge to the test.
I wanted to see if i could handle data, edit/delete and add data responsively.
I will come back to this project later to see how much i have improved.

To see a working example of this, please follow the link below to my CodePen:
